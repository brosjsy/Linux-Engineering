# üêß Linux Engineer Hands-On Journey

Welcome to my public GitHub portfolio where I document my learning journey as a **Linux Engineer**. Each section includes screenshots, explanations, and commands I've used during my hands-on labs. This is a living document, updated regularly as I grow.

## üîß Virtualization Setup

### ‚úÖ Tools Installed

- **VirtualBox**  
  VirtualBox is one of the most commonly used hypervisors for running Linux OS in a virtual environment.

- **VMware Workstation (Optional)**  
  Alternative to VirtualBox, used for running virtual machines with more advanced features.

**üìã Requirements:**

- Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
- CPU with virtualization support (Intel VT-x / AMD-V)
- 4GB RAM or more

**üîß Installation Steps:**

1. Download VMware Workstation Player/Pro  
   üëâ [VMware Download Link](https://www.vmware.com/go/getworkstation)
2. Run the installer and accept license terms.
3. Choose default settings or customize features.
4. Restart your computer after installation.

## üì∏ Taking Snapshots (Best Practice)

Snapshots provide a critical **restore point** before making risky system changes. They help maintain a clean rollback path in case something breaks during updates or configuration.

**üõ†Ô∏è How I Took My Snapshot:**

1. Click on `Machine` ‚Üí `Take Snapshot`
2. Name the snapshot
3. Add a useful description, like:

> **"System update - cron job setup before 8:30 AM"**

Files and Permissions
````
## üìÅ Linux Files and Directory Permissions (Letters)

Linux permissions are represented by letters:

r = read

w = write

x = execute
````
ls -l
# -rw-r--r-- 1 user group 0 May 13 08:30 file.txt
chmod u+x script.sh     # Add execute permission to the user
chmod g-w file.txt      # Remove write from group
chmod o+r file.txt      # Add read for others
````
## üî¢ Files and Directory Permissions (Numeric)
Each permission has a value: r = 4, w = 2, x = 1
````
chmod 755 script.sh     # rwxr-xr-x
chmod 644 file.txt      # rw-r--r--
````
üë• File Ownership Commands
Check ownership and change ownership
````
ls -l
chown newuser file.txt         # Change owner
chown newuser:newgroup file.txt # Change owner and group
````
## Access Control List (ACL)
ACL provides more fine-grained permission control.
Enable ACL on filesystem:
````mount -o remount,acl / ````
Set ACL:
````setfacl -m u:john:rwx file.txt````
````getfacl file.txt````
## üß≠ Navigation & Productivity üÜò Help Commands

````
##üìã Using tee to Save and Display

````
echo "Log line" | tee logfile.txt
````
##üîó Pipes

The | Pipes command is used for chaining or channelling initial command to produce a fine output 
````
ls -l | grep ".txt"
````
